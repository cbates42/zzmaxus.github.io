  Hi, my name is Cameron Bates, I'm a student at Columbia College Chicago, majoring in Game Design.
  <h1>Learning 2D animation</h1>
  I've recently been trying to pick up 2D pixel art, and am starting to get happy with my progress in developing the skill. I like the idea of being able to create
  my own sprites for my games sometimes, so I created this sprite intended for a Fire Emblem-inspired game:
  
  
  
  
  <h1>Inari Level</h1>
  I blocked out a small level for Inari, a game I'm working on at Columbia. The main idea that was decided for the first level is that it would take place at a festival, and have the player defeat the demons around the town.

  At first I kind of wanted to have some non-linearity in the level, but I decided to just have it be a shorter linear level. I got through it kind of quickly, but I think a newer player would take a little longer to get used to how the combat and movement is. Especially the walljump. One thing I would want to do is add a longer rooftop section after the current end of the level.

  <h1>Animation from a spritesheet</h1>
  I recently tried out learning more about using spritesheets to create 2D animations in Unity, and managed to use one pre-made spritesheet to do so. Using this 
  Nightborne Warrior by CreativeKind spritesheet: https://creativekind.itch.io/nightborne-warrior
  I was able to create a few animations to be used in unity.

  Using these sprites I created the animations seen in this video:

  I mainly chose this spritesheet because I thought it'd be interesting to use as inspiration for another idea I have, and would likely give a decent base for that idea.
