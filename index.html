<h1>Hello World</h1>
<p>Hi, my name is Cameron Bates. I'm currently a student at Columbia College Chicago, majoring in Game Design.
  
  I recently tried out learning more about using spritesheets to create 2D animations in Unity, and managed to use one pre-made spritesheet to do so. Using this 
  Nightborne Warrior by CreativeKind spritesheet: https://creativekind.itch.io/nightborne-warrior
  I was able to create a few animations to be used in unity.

  Using these sprites I created the animations seen in this video:

  I mainly chose this spritesheet because I thought it'd be interesting to use as inspiration for another idea I have, and would likely give a decent base for that idea.
